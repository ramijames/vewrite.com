## What is Vewrite? 

Simply put, Vewrite is a project management tool for technical writers. 

- Organize your **projects**
- Create **workflows** that fit your needs
- Manage **deliverables** through workflows
- Track **progress** for stakeholders

Deeply integrated into Vewrite is a talent marketplace that allows your team to quickly add capacity if you need it. 

This, of course, also means that **Vewrite is a place for technical writers to find work and get paid**.

### A Project Management tool for Technical Writers

As an experienced team of technical writers, project managers, and developer relations specialists, we know how painful it can be to try and manage a large set of content that is in production. 

The market currently does not provide a toolset that caters to the work that we do. We make do.

We end up using tools that are either a bad fit for our workflow, or are tailored for an entirely different use-case. We aren't developers, working with an agile methodology, and we aren't marketers with a stream of tasks. We have many deliverables, stakeholders who require visibility, and we are juggling multiple projects at once.

Vewrite is a product tailored to that problem-set. We want technical writers, developer relations specialists, and the teams that they work on to have clear workflows, excellent visibility, and access to resources that help them get their work done on-time and on-budget.

## A Preference for Workflows over Tasks

It's very straightforward to be task-oriented, and that works fine if you're just one person with a pile of work. You self-prioritize and move from task to task. Often people create a daily or weekly to-do list, and plow forward. 

That's fine at a certain scale, but when you're trying to manage a small- or medium-sized team, with multiple projects, many deliverables, and lots of in-progress work in different states, it can quickly become unmanageable. 

Common problems with the pile-o-tasks methodology are:

- **Lack of visibility** - Nobody is really sure what is still left to do
- **Unclear states** - Nobody is really sure whether stuff is done or not
- **Scope creep** - The state of a deliverable is turned into a task because the process wasn't clear from the get-go

Having a well-defined **Workflow** can ensure that there is a clear set of states that your deliverables flow through. This means that when you initialize your project you know both the scoped of the deliverables your client will receive and the steps that your team needs to go through to achieve success.

Most modern project management software, including JIRA, Monday, etc. are task-oriented and not workflow-oriented. This is why every project that you run within them feels endless. The actual scope of work is unclear because the focus is on the deliverable and not on the process to achieve completion.

### Project-level Progess Visibility Makes Everyone Happy

Most project management tools aren't there to make your job easier. They are there to make your project manager's job easier. They act as a way to collate the status of all the myriad tasks that have been assigned. Often they include a way to create reports and other analytics which show success (or failure) over time.

The effect of this, for daily users, is that they feel like they work for the software that they use, instead of the other way around.
